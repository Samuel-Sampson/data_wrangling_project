# data_wrangling_project
This is a project that is part of the Udacity Data Analysis nanodegree program.

The purpose of this project is to wrangle data from the WeRateDogs twitter archive, cleaning the data so that it is presented in a tidy format, and then providing some insights with the cleaned data.

This project contains three files:
1) A jupyter notebook containing the code for the data wrangling and cleaning process
2) A file reporting on the data wrangling process
3) A report containing visualizations and insights into the cleaned data
